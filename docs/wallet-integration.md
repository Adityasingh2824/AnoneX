# Wallet Integration Guide

AnoneX supports multiple Aleo wallets for connecting and transacting on the network.

## Supported Wallets

### 1. Leo Wallet 🦁
- **Website**: [https://leo.app/](https://leo.app/)
- **Install**: Chrome Extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leo-wallet/)
- **Status**: Primary wallet, fully supported
- **Features**: Full transaction support, record management, ZK proofs

### 2. Puzzle Wallet 🧩
- **Website**: [https://puzzle.online/wallet](https://puzzle.online/wallet)
- **Install**: Available on iOS, Android, and Chrome
- **Status**: Auto-detected when installed
- **Features**: 
  - Native Arcade for earning opportunities
  - Full Aleo transaction support
  - Mobile and desktop support
  - Account abstraction for smooth UX

## How It Works

### Auto-Detection
When you visit AnoneX, the app automatically detects installed wallets:
- Leo Wallet (browser extension)
- Puzzle Wallet (browser extension or mobile app)

### Connection Flow

1. **Click "Connect Wallet"**
   - If wallets are installed, you'll see a selection modal
   - If no wallets are installed, demo mode is available

2. **Select Your Wallet**
   - Choose Leo Wallet or Puzzle Wallet
   - Approve the connection request

3. **Start Using AnoneX**
   - Your wallet address is used to generate a pseudonym
   - All transactions are signed by your wallet
   - Your private keys never leave your wallet

### Demo Mode
If no wallet is installed, AnoneX automatically enables **Demo Mode**:
- Simulates wallet connection
- Allows you to explore the UI
- Transactions are simulated locally
- Perfect for testing without installing a wallet

## Transaction Flow

1. **User Action** (e.g., "Create Post")
2. **Content Encryption** → Upload to IPFS
3. **ZK Proof Generation** → Generated by wallet or delegated proving
4. **Transaction Signing** → Your wallet signs the transaction
5. **Broadcast to Aleo** → Transaction sent to network
6. **Confirmation** → Wait for network confirmation

## Wallet Features Used

- **Account Management**: Wallet handles all key management
- **Transaction Signing**: All transactions signed by wallet
- **Record Decryption**: Wallet decrypts your private records
- **Network Connection**: Wallet connects to Aleo Testnet/Mainnet

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Not Detected
1. Make sure the wallet extension is installed and enabled
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Connection Failed
1. Check if wallet is unlocked
2. Ensure you're on the correct network (Testnet Beta)
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
4. Check wallet permissions

### Transaction Failed
1. Ensure you have enough Aleo credits
2. Get testnet credits from [faucet.aleo.org](https://faucet.aleo.org/)
3. Check transaction parameters
4. Verify network connection

## Getting Testnet Credits

1. Visit [https://faucet.aleo.org/](https://faucet.aleo.org/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet credits
4. Wait for confirmation

## Security Notes

- **Never share your private keys**
- **Always verify transaction details before signing**
- **Only connect to trusted dApps**
- **Keep your wallet software updated**

## Development

For developers integrating wallets:

```typescript
import { useWallet } from '@/components/wallet/WalletProvider'

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    isConnected, 
    address, 
    connect, 
    disconnect,
    requestTransaction 
  } = useWallet()

  // Use wallet functions
}
```
